  Description:
    Abstract: District level Administrative Boundaries of Afghanistan contains 329 districts boundaries for Afghanistan, mapped at 1:100,000(based on 1:250000 scale. The coverage has polygon topology and was uploaded from land cover 1:25000(1993) which was digitized by FAO (Rome) and later was converted and updated to ESRI shapefile mapped at 1:100,000 scale at AIMS office.
    Purpose: The polygon provides a ready reference for 329 district level boundaries at 1:100,000 scale. Not for use at scale larger than 1:100,000. Data at this scale is suitable for use in regional studies and planning.

      Process_Description:
        District Level Boundaries of Afghanistan, contains 329 District level boundaries for Afghanistan. The shapefile has polygon topology and was created in AtlasGIS by (USAID) and later on was updated 
        to ArcView shapefile at AIMS. shapefile attributes were carefully examined for accuracy based on existing source material (USDMA 100K maps)and limitations of scale. NODE ERRORS were resolved. The shapefile was CLEANED and BUILT with POLYGON topology.
